# Learning tests

Inspired by Chapter 4.1, "Exploring JavaScript with Unit Tests", of Christian Johansen's [_Test-Driven JavaScript Development_](http://tddjs.com/):

> For this purpose we can write learning tests, i.e., unit tests written with the goal of learning, not with the goal of testing the exercised interface per se.
> ...
> Rather than playing with an array and the splice method in a browser console, we put the test in a file. With a minimum of added overhead, we now have a repeatable experiment that documents what we just learned, perfect for later review.
> ...
> Testing built-in functionality like this might seem to contradict our usual attitude toward unit testing: never to test code that we didn’t write ourselves, and to mock or stub external dependencies while testing. These are still valuable pieces of advice, but they do not apply to learning tests. Learning tests aren’t a part of production code; they live in a separate repository, a personal repository, and they help us document our knowledge and our learning experience.
